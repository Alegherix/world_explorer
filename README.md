# [World Explorer](https://worldexploration.netlify.app/)

In this exciting 3D platformer, you are in control of a sphere visiting three different planets with their own unique twist and turns!

Two planets are single-player only where you collect as many coins as possible, whilst racing against the clock. Challenge your friends and make it to the top of the leaderboard.
The third planet is online multiplayer where you can enjoy together with your friends and race to the finish line!
